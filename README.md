# Battleships
This is my take on the famous game battleships. It also has a computer enemy.

This has been my biggest project to date, and it took me more than 1000 lines of code to implement.
It is my take on the popular game Battleships which was also on of the first games to be turned into a video
game. In the project I make use of the object orientation of java. The ships, the battlefields and the
coordinates all have their respective classes interacting with each other. Another big aspect of this
project was the single player mode for which I came up with an algorithm which systematically imitates the
way that I personally play the game.

In order to run it, just execute the main method in the Main class.
